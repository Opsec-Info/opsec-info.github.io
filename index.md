This site is designed to collect and maintain up-to-date information about how to stay safe in a variety of situations and to teach you how and why certain practices have been adopted. **There is no one catch-all tool or technology or practice to keep you safe in all situations**, you should understand how different tools and practices work in order to properly apply them to your specific situation and to **know when the situation has changed enough to warrant a change in tools or practices**.

As we all collectively learn more about how these tools and practices work and the ways in which they are countered by the state and others, **the information contained here will change** to reflect new knowledge and new ideas.

This project was started with a focus on aiding those engaged in police and prison abolition, anti-colonialism and anti-racism struggles, and mutual aid projects on the unceded lands of the Duwamish people. Security information is highly context dependent and the tools involved also present more risk in places where they are illegal or may make you a target for increased surveillance. If you are currently living or contemplating actions elsewhere, please look up any concerns for your locale and consider [submitting new information](how-to-contribute.html) to help your friends stay up-to-date!
