# Siloed Email

We encourage creating an email for specific purposes to not sharing concerns across identies. We suggest: 

1. Making a [protonmail](https://protonmail.com/signup) email [^1]
    - It'll ask for username, password, plan (select free), walk through a captcha, and set a display name. You can skip the recovery email and phone number when it asks here.

3. Using [AnonymSMS](https://anonymsms.com/) for phone verification [^2]
    - Click on a phone number and copy it
    - In proton mail, click on your initials in the upper right corner

    - Click save and a pop up will appear for a code
    - Go back to AnonySMS, wait a few seconds, and refresh the page

[^1]: Many emails require some kind of verification or backup email with different restrictions. Proton is flexible enough to allow this form of verification through. 
[^2]: There are many online sites to grab free phone numbers and you're welcome to find one that works for you. We've found this one to be reliable and easily lets you see the text messages that come through.
